      <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
      <p>
I’m a Full-Stack and Mobile App Developer with over 1.6 years of experience working with Java 8, PHP, JavaScript, React Native, ReactJS, Spring Boot, and MySQL. I specialize in building and deploying web and mobile applications, creating and integrating REST APIs, and developing scalable backend systems. From gathering requirements to designing, coding, testing, and deploying applications, I manage the full project lifecycle. I’m comfortable using tools like Postman and cloud hosting platforms to deliver efficient, user-friendly, and high-performance solutions.      </p>
      <p>
        My work spans across real estate, education platforms — all developed from scratch, delivered with clean code, database design, and production deployment. I’ve built features like OTP-based login, dynamic listing fetch, admin-side controls, and user-specific functionalities like favorites/likes.
      </p>
      <p>
        My strength lies in building systems that not only work — but also solve real business problems. I take ownership from idea to execution and focus on delivering stable, modern, and responsive solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
          I am actively seeking challenging roles where I can further sharpen my technical skills, apply my expertise in full-stack and mobile app development, and deliver high-quality, scalable solutions. I am committed to learning continuously, taking ownership of projects, and contributing effectively to team goals while exceeding expectations.
